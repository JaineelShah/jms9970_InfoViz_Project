The goal of this project is visualizing the NYC Athletics facilities dataset containing all of the government facilities that can be permitted for athletic activity and facilities that are specifically designated for sports but are not available for permitting. Combining this with the NYC Census Data to comprehend and analyze how access and availability of sports facilities in each block in NYC is affected by the median income of that neighbourhood and other economic demographics.

The objective of the project consists of two parts:
a) Visualize the sport facilities in NYC which has all the public places for sports that people are allowed to use, as well as some other public places just for sports that people can’t reserve ahead of time. Interactive dashboard which can be filtered by various parameters like location of the facility, borough and primary sports permitted.
b) Visualize the Median income and economic demographic information of NYC vs the output of part ’a’, in order to analyze key socioeconomic indicators to see if the median income of that neighbourhood, affects the number of sports facilities in that neighbourhood and what are the prominent sport distribution in different income regions.
